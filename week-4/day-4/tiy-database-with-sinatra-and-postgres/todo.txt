x This page should show a form to fill in the details of an employee
x On the employee *index* URL there should be a _search_ form that allows you to type in some text and click a *search* button
- When showing a player use a nice format for showing all of the user's information.
- Maybe use a `list-group` or other bootstrap component to format the data
- When clicking the _submit_ button for this form, a new employee should be created
